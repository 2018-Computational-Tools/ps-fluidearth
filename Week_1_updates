# Fluid Earth Group Meeting Summary

We met as a group on Friday, October 19 to decide what vision we have for creating a computational assignment, and to create a plan.

We decided that Analytical Paper #10 would be a good place to start -

The existing problem set relies on:
  1. sketching plots of heat conduction (an ideal application on a python code)
  2. Investigating fundamental controls on a temperature step change in an Alaskan soil
  3. Using matlab to plot a hillslope profile

We think that students can therefore use computational tools to:
1. Produce their own professional looking plots for the first question
2. Use code commenting to demonstrate an understanding of the levers in the Alaska problem
3. Functionally use a python code in the same way the matlab code had previously been used

What we are going to do:
- As a group we are going to write these problems in both R and python so students can use the platform they are most familiar with
- We are also aiming to write this problem set in a way so that students are still tackling conceptual problems, rather than writing original code
- We have a meeting set for Monday, October 29 to discuss first attempts at code writing, and to decide if we would also like to do a second Analytical paper (likely either #1 or #5)
