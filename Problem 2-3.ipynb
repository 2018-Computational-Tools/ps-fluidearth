    "### Problem 2:\n",
    "The graph below (from Bob and Suzanne Anderson’s $\\textit{Geomorphology: Mechanics and Chemistry of Landscapes}$) shows temperature records collected from a borehole in Alaska between 1977 and 2003. Referring to the 2003 profile, use Fourier’s law to infer the direction in which heat was flowing in the permafrost during 2003 in these two areas of the profile: (a) above 30 m depth and (b) below 40 m depth. Then, (c) suppose you only had data from the year 2003 and therefore had no independent information about whether various points in the profile are warming, cooling, or maintaining a steady temperature. Based on the physics of heat conduction, predict whether the temperature at ∼35 meters depth likely increased, decreased, or stayed the same during the year 2004."

    "The data shown in the figure on the next page have been interpreted as indicating that the ground-surface temperature in this part of the arctic has warmed over the past few decades. Suppose, however, that you ONLY had data from the year 2003, and were therefore unable to directly assess the changes in the permafrost temperature over time. In such a case, a skeptic might argue that the shape of the curve in 2003 could just as easily be interpreted as resulting from differences in the thermal conductivity, $k$, at different depths in the profile, and therefore that the data do not prove that surface warming has occurred. Based on the physics of heat conduction, would such an argument be justified? Why or why not?\n"
