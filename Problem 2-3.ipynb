    "#### D) The data shown in the figure have been interpreted as indicating that the ground-surface temperature in this part of the arctic has warmed over the past few decades. Suppose, however, that you ONLY had data from the year 2003, and were therefore unable to directly assess the changes in the permafrost temperature over time. In such a case, a skeptic might argue that the shape of the curve in 2003 could just as easily be interpreted as resulting from differences in the thermal conductivity, $k$, at different depths in the profile, and therefore that the data do not prove that surface warming has occurred.  Based on the physics of heat conduction, would such an argument be justified? Please copy the code from your first problem to create a simple plot to support your answer."
